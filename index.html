  <h2>About Me: Finding the Flow</h2>
  <p>
    My professional journey began with degrees in Clinical Psychology and Modern Languages, building a foundation in analytical thinking and communication. Working remotely for international startups revealed my talent for optimizing complex operations across global teams, igniting a passion for streamlining workflows – from marketing and sales to client delivery – through technology and automation. Now based in New York City and currently enrolled in the AI Native Program at Pursuit, I'm focused on mastering AI to create transformative operational solutions. My goal is to achieve "Flow": making processes seamless, efficient, and effective.
